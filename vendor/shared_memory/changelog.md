# 0.12.0
- Windows implementation now follows POSIX behavior in regards to ownership and deletion, see [#59](https://github.com/elast0ny/shared_memory-rs/pull/59) for more details
# __0.11.X__
This release breaks backwards compatibility and removes a bunch of previous features which hid many unsafe behaviors (automatically casting shared memory to Rust types).

The release also marks the split between `shared_memory` and its synchronization primitives into a seperate crate `raw_sync`.
